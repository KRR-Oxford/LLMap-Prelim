# LLMap-Prelim

This repository contains code for the preliminary investigation of ontology alignment with large language models, using two challenging subsets extracted from the [OAEI Bio-ML Track (2023)](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/projects/ConCur/oaei/2023/index.html).

The associated poster paper: "Exploring Large Language Models for Ontology Alignment", accepted at [ISWC 2023 Posters & Demos](https://iswc2023.semanticweb.org/).
